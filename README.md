Cursor-Following Spiral Squares

This project creates a visually engaging effect on a webpage where a series of squares in varying shades of blue follow the cursor in a spiral pattern. Each square is randomly sized and colored, and they revolve around the cursor, creating a dynamic and interactive user experience.
Features

    Dynamic Cursor Trail: Squares follow the cursor in a spiral formation, creating a continuous and engaging visual trail.
    Randomized Square Properties: Each square has a randomly assigned size and shade of blue, making the trail unique and vibrant.
    Customizable Parameters: The speed of rotation, size of the squares, and spacing of the spiral can be easily adjusted in the code.
    Fading Effect: Squares gradually fade away, adding to the aesthetic appeal.

Implementation

The project is implemented using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It utilizes the <canvas> element for drawing the squares and JavaScript for handling cursor movement and rendering the animation.
Files

    index.html: Contains the basic structure of the webpage and the canvas element.
    style.css: Provides styling for the canvas and the overall webpage.
    script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for the cursor-following spiral effect.

Development Stages

The project evolved through several stages, enhancing its complexity and visual appeal:

    Basic Line Following Cursor
    Spiral Line Formation
    Replacing Line with Squares
    Styling Squares
    Increasing Square Size
    Spacing and Randomization
    Further Spacing Adjustments
    Color Variation and Size Randomization
    Revolving Speed Control

Each stage introduced new features and improvements, leading to the final dynamic and interactive design.
Usage

To use this effect on your website, include the index.html, style.css, and script.js files in your project. Ensure that the canvas element is correctly positioned and sized according to your needs.
Customization

You can customize the effect by modifying the script.js file. Key parameters such as spiralRadius, baseSquareSize, and rotationSpeed can be adjusted to change the appearance and behavior of the spiral.
Browser Compatibility

This project is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML5 and JavaScript.
